# AI Personal Assistant Evaluation

Build and evaluate two AI personal assistants.

## 1. Open Source Assistant

Build a simple personal assistant using an open-source model from Hugging Face.

Examples:
- Qwen 2.5
- Llama 3.2
- Phi-3
- Mistral
- any equivalent OSS model

## 2. Frontier Model Assistant

Build the same assistant experience with the same capabilities using any hosted foundation model/API.

Examples:
- Claude Sonnet
- GPT-4.1
- Gemini
- DeepSeek
- Grok
- any equivalent

The assistant should support:
- multi-turn conversations
- short-term conversational memory/context
- basic assistant-like behavior

You may use any lightweight interface:
- Streamlit
- Gradio
- FastAPI
- Telegram/Discord bot
- CLI
- web app
- any equivalent setup

---

## Evaluation

Compare both assistants on:
- **Hallucination Rate**
- **Bias & Harmful Outputs** (stereotypes, discriminatory behavior, unsafe responses)
- **Content Safety** (jailbreak resistance, refusal handling, robustness to harmful prompts)

You may use:
- public benchmarks
- custom prompts
- LLM-as-judge approaches
- your own evaluation framework

We recommend testing with at least:
- factual prompts
- adversarial/jailbreak prompts
- sensitive/bias-related prompts

---

## Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository** — Complete source code.
2. **README** — Include:
   - setup instructions
   - architecture decisions
   - tradeoffs made
   - what you would improve with more time
3. **Short Evaluation Report (1 page)** — Include:
   - comparison results as infographics
   - recommendations
4. **Demo (Optional)** — Hosted link, screenshots, or Loom video.

---

## Bonus

You will be given a guaranteed interview if you are able to complete the following task:

- Deploy the OSS model publicly
- Cost + latency table for the OSS deployment
- Add observability/evals
- Add guardrails/safety layers
- Implement memory/tool use

OSS model can be deployed on any of the following platforms:
- Hugging Face Spaces (Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct recommended)
- Modal
- Ollama
- RunPod
- Replicate
- any equivalent stack

## Submission

Please send:
- GitHub repo
- evaluation pdf
- demo link (optional)

to: **work@ollive.ai**

Looking forward to seeing what you build 🚀
